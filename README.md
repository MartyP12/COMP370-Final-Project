In this project, our group attempted to examine the social media response and visibility of the newly released movie Wicked: For Good in comparison to other recently released movies. We focused on looking at posts from various subreddits on Reddit. The stakeholders specifically wanted to know which aspect of the movie was the focus of the Reddit post and how much coverage the movie received relative to other movies released at a similar time. Our pool of movies was: Wicked: For Good, Predator: Badlands, Sinners, Nuremberg, and Fantastic Four: First Steps. We found that the top 3 aspects of posts concerning Wicked: For Good were focused on reviews, release & distribution, and comparisons to other movies/franchises. Concerning the second question, we found that early discourse surrounding Wicked: For Good was heavily shaped by its position in the release cycle. It was shown that Reddit emphasized reviews and release-related information, rather than plot discussion/analysis. Although the movie received good attention relative to other movies in our dataset, its recent release date limited the number of posts concerning deeper topics and discussions. Our results and discussion conveyed to stakeholders what audiences were discussing, and why certain types of posts were more prevalent than others, depending on the stage of a movie’s release cycle.
